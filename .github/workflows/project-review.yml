# TODO Check review
# When a pull request review is submitted, check the status. If the status was
# approved by the instructor, then indicate the request is being processed.
# Otherwise, do nothing.
#
# To process the request, check the review comment. There are three possible
# results:
#
# 1. Resubmit for another normal review -or- quick review. Apply the appropriate
#    labels and respond with instructions for how to request the next appointment.
#    Include what range of dates the next appointment should occur.
#
# 2. Conditional pass or pass. Apply the appropriate labels and respond with
#    instructions for how to prepare the final release. Include when the final
#    release should be created by to avoid late penalties.
#
# 3. Other. This could be associated with a cancelled review for some reason. No
#    labels should be applied.
